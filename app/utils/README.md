### Code Explanation: `convertFileToBase64` Function in `utils.ts`

---

The `convertFileToBase64` function in the `utils.ts` file is designed to convert a file, typically an image, to a Base64 string. This conversion is commonly used in web applications to embed binary data within a text-based format like HTML or JSON. Let's break down how this function works:

#### Function Structure

```typescript
export const convertFileToBase64 = (file: any) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Function body
});
```

- **Exporting the Function**: The use of `export` makes this function available for import in other modules.
- **Function Parameters**: It takes one parameter, `file`, which represents the file to be converted.
- **Return Type**: The function returns a `Promise`. This is essential because file reading is an asynchronous operation.

#### Asynchronous File Reading

```typescript
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
```

- **FileReader Instance**: A `FileReader` object is created to read the content of the file.
- **Reading the File**: `reader.readAsDataURL(file)` starts reading the file's contents. The `readAsDataURL` method is used to read the content of the file and encode it as a Base64 string.

#### Handling the File Read Completion

```typescript
reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result);
```

- **On Load Event**: Once the file is successfully read, the `onload` event is triggered.
- **Resolving the Promise**: The `resolve` function of the `Promise` is called with `reader.result`, which contains the Base64 encoded string of the file.

#### Error Handling

```typescript
reader.onerror = error => reject(error);
```

- **On Error Event**: If an error occurs during the file reading process, the `onerror` event is triggered.
- **Rejecting the Promise**: The `reject` function is called with the error object, effectively signaling that the Promise has not been fulfilled due to an error.

#### Console Logging

```typescript
console.log('converting image to Base64');
console.log('image CONVERTED');
```

- These `console.log` statements are helpful for debugging purposes, indicating the start and completion of the conversion process.

#### Summary

The `convertFileToBase64` function is a utility that efficiently converts files to a Base64 string, utilizing the `FileReader` API for asynchronous operations and handling both successful read and error scenarios. This function is particularly useful in scenarios where binary data needs to be transferred over text-based protocols or embedded in web pages.
